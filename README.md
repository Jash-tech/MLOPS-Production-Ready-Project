# MLOPS-Production-Ready-Project
1. Repos created and Cloned in local System with git Bash.
2. Folder Structure created.
3. Requirements added and installed.


# Day5:
Data Ingestion:
- data drift with evidently ai--MLOPs Tool

### Workflow:
1. Constants
2. Entity
- config entity
- artifact entity
3. Configuration/mongodb.py
4. data access/us_vis_data.py
5. data Ingestion, try running in pipeline/training_pipeline
6. Push data (except artifact)

## Day 6:
Data Drift with Evidently AI:
CLT Theorem: (Random selected) Distribution of sample should be similar to the distribution of polpulation (n>30)
If it is not then it is problem of data drift.
Distribution of Train sample= Distribution of Test sample
1. Data Validation with Evidently AI
